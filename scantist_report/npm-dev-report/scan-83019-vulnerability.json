AngularJS users using JQuery should upgrade JQuery to 3.5.0, as a similar vulnerability [affects jQuery <3.5.0](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2).\n\n### Workarounds\nChanging sanitizer configuration not to allow certain tag grouping (e.g. `<option><style></option>`) or inline style elements may stop certain exploitation vectors, but it's uncertain if all possible exploitation vectors would be covered. Upgrade of AngularJS to 1.8.0 is recommended.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mhp6-pxh8-r675\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-jpcq-cgw6-v4j6\nhttps://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/\nhttps://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ANGULAR-570058", "File Path": "npm-dev/package.json", "Criticality": "Low", "Score": 1.0, "Issue Status": "none", "Priority": "", "Comments": "", "Patched Version": "", "Patched Version Release Date": "", "Latest Component Version": "1.8.3", "Latest Library Version Release Date": "2022-04-07 22:12:36 +0000", "Project": "npm-dev", "Vulnerability Report Time": "2022-09-26 17:55:02 +0000", "CWE ID": "CWE-79", "CWE Description": "The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users."}, {"Vulnerability ID": "SEC-2019-10284", "Library": "angular", "Language": "js", "Status": "matched", "Scope": "dependencies", "Library Version": "1.3.19", "Library Version Release Date": "2015-09-16 21:19:22 +0000", "License": ["MIT License"], "License Type": ["Permissive"], "Issue Source": "ci", "Issue Type": "bug", "Description": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS): angular is an open-source JavaScript framework.
